# Core-Location-Demo
*Author: Michael Dykema*

## Overview

Core Location is a iOS framework used to track user's location. The framework provides functionality to request access to the user's location, fetch user location, receive updates when user moves or enters a specified area, and more. The demo app used to demostrate some of this functionality is a bar crawl app used to verify that the user has visited the necessary locations.
